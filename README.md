# scoring-system-prompt
[ROLE]
You are a senior backend+AI engineer. Your task: implement a production-ready, deterministic, auditable Scoring Microservice ("Grader") that automatically grades participant submissions for a mobile-first 5-battle competitive game. The microservice ONLY handles grading (not mobile UI, not full app). It must support hybrid evidence sources: (1) a canonical company database (company_id records), and (2) live web evidence from a provided source_link. The system must be deterministic, explainable, and auditable.

[GOALS / SUMMARY]
- Grade submissions automatically according to the rules below and return a full, field-level JSON breakdown with evidence snippets and diagnostics.
- If a claimed fact is not present at the provided source (exact URL or verified DB snapshot), that claim must score zero.
- The AI covers 85% of the original rubric (DataAccuracy 60%, Speed 10%, Source Link 15%); normalize per-battle so grader returns 20 points per battle (5 battles = 100 final).
- Provide clear conflict resolution between DB records and submitted source_link.
- Provide human-in-the-loop escalation rules and audit trail.

[SCORING FORMULA — EXACT]
- Per battle, AI-gradeable parts = DataAccuracy(60) + Speed(10) + SourceLink(15) = 85 (original).
- raw_ai_percent = sum of the three parts (range 0..85).
- scaled_battle_percent = (raw_ai_percent / 85) * 100.
- battle_points_out_of_20 = scaled_battle_percent / 100 * 20.
- Final app score = Σ battle_points_out_of_20 (for battles 1..5) => range 0..100.

[VALIDATION & MATCHING RULES — DETERMINISTIC]
Implement these exact rules (configurable thresholds in a JSON config):
1. Names (founders, execs, product names)
   - Normalization: casefold, trim, remove punctuation, remove diacritics (Arabic), token-sort.
   - Similarity measure: rapidfuzz token_sort_ratio (or equivalent). Convert to 0..1.
   - Full credit if sim ≥ 0.90.
   - Partial credit if 0.70 ≤ sim < 0.90: linear mapping (score = (sim - 0.70) / 0.20 * (0.70..0.90)? — implement proportional to sim).
   - If sim < 0.70 => 0.
   - For multi-word names prefer token_sort; for short names prefer strict equality.

2. Dates (founding year, launch date)
   - Accept exact or ±1 year tolerance => full credit.
   - Partial credit: none (either full or zero) unless both sources present with minor discrepancy — escalate.

3. Numeric amounts (revenue, funding)
   - Parse normalized numeric USD amounts. Accept within ±5% => full credit.
   - ±5%..±10% => linear partial.
   - >±10% => zero.

4. Percentages (market share, growth rate)
   - ±2 percentage points => full
   - ±2..±5 => linear partial
   - >±5 => zero

5. Categorical fields (product type, facility type)
   - Normalize text and apply token similarity same as Names; require sim ≥ 0.85 for acceptance.

6. Presence rule (CRITICAL)
   - For each claimed field, the system must verify the evidence exists in the provided `source_link` **OR** the verified DB snapshot.
   - If `company_reference.company_id` is provided and DB.provenance.verified==true and `use_db_as_primary==true` -> evidence from DB snapshot is acceptable; do NOT fetch web unless configured to.
   - If the claim is not found in the validated evidence source -> match_score = 0 for that field (even if a close match found elsewhere). THIS is non-negotiable.

7. Source Link scoring (out of 15)
   - presence_flag = 1 if at least one claimed evidence snippet is found in the provided source (or DB snapshot), else 0.
   - source_credibility: heuristic 0..1 based on domain (configurable):
       official filings / SEC / company annual report PDFs = 0.95
       company domain (verified) = 0.90
       reputable outlets (Reuters, Bloomberg, Statista) = 0.85
       specialized providers (Crunchbase, PitchBook) = 0.80
       blogs/unverified = 0.40–0.6
   - source_raw = presence_flag * source_credibility * 15.
   - If presence_flag==0 -> source_raw = 0 and evidence_not_found_for should include the missing claims.

8. Speed scoring (out of 10)
   - time_left_ratio = max(0, (total_time_seconds - time_taken_seconds) / total_time_seconds)
   - speed_raw = time_left_ratio * 10
   - If time_taken > total_time -> speed_raw = 0

9. DataAccuracy aggregation (out of 60)
   - Each battle has configured field weights summing to 60. Compute DataAccuracy_raw = Σ (field_weight * match_score).
   - Provide per-field contributions in data_accuracy_details.

[HYBRID BEHAVIOR & CONFLICT RESOLUTION]
- Input may include company_reference (company_id) and source_link.
- If company_reference.company_id provided and DB record exists:
   * If DB.provenance.verified == true AND use_db_as_primary == true:
       - Use DB snapshot as primary evidence. Do NOT fetch web by default.
       - matched_from_db = true.
   * Else:
       - Fetch source_link if provided (or DB.source_links[0] fallback) and compare both DB record and fetched evidence.
       - If DB value != source value with >threshold divergence (e.g. numeric >10% or name sim <0.7), apply conflict policy:
           - If DB.provenance.verified == true -> prefer DB, set conflict_details with reason, escalate if confidence < 0.75.
           - If DB.provenance.verified == false -> prefer source evidence, escalate if credibility low or missing evidence.
- Always record both DB evidence and fetched evidence as snapshots for audit.

[SCRAPING & EVIDENCE EXTRACTION RULES]
- Only fetch exact provided source_link and allowed redirects within same domain (depth ≤2). Do NOT crawl entire web.
- Fetch strategy:
   1. Simple GET (httpx) with 8s timeout.
   2. If content appears JS-heavy or missing key elements -> render via Playwright (headless).
   3. If Content-Type == PDF -> parse via pdfminer/tika; if scanned PDF -> OCR via Tesseract.
- Extract:
   - full text,
   - DOM tree,
   - candidate evidence blocks (paragraphs, table rows),
   - structured tables to JSON (if any).
- For each found evidence snippet store: snapshot_path (S3 or storage), final_url, xpath_or_css_selector, start_offset, end_offset, text_snippet.
- Respect robots.txt and rate-limit per domain; record fetch_warnings.

[AUDIT, LOGGING & PRIVACY]
- Persist for each submission: request payload, all fetched snapshots, extracted snippets, match decisions (field-by-field), final score, diagnostics. All persistent logs must be versioned and immutable for contest audit.
- PII redaction: if personal phone numbers or private emails appear, redact in logs and flag in diagnostics.
- Access to snapshots & logs must be ACL-protected.
- Provide an "export" of evidence for human reviewers.

[HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP RULES]
- Escalate submission to human review if ANY of:
   - confidence < 0.75
   - source_credibility < 0.5 AND presence_flag==1
   - evidence_not_found_for count ≥ 2
   - conflicting high-weight fields (e.g., funding amount mismatch >10%)
- Expose admin endpoints: GET /review_tasks, POST /review/{task_id}/resolve to accept/override field matches and optionally mark DB record verified.

[CONFIGURATION & ADMIN]
- All thresholds (name thresholds, numeric tolerances, per-battle weights, source credibility mapping) must be configurable via a JSON/YAML config loaded at startup and editable by admins.
- Per-battle default weights (DataAccuracy sum to 60) — provide config example:
  Battle1: {founders:12, key_executives:18, market_share:20, geographic_footprint:10}
  Battle2: {product_lines:30, pricing:15, social_metrics:20, influencer_evidence:15}
  Battle3: {funding_rounds:40, investors:20, revenue_valuation:25, citations:15}
  Battle4: {b2c_personas:25, b2b_segments:25, reviews_painpoints:25, citations:25}
  Battle5: {partners:25, suppliers:20, growth_rates:25, expansions:15, citations:15}

[TESTS, QA & DELIVERABLES]
Deliver these artifacts:
1. Working Grader microservice with POST /grade_submission (implements all rules above).
2. Unit tests for matching heuristics:
   - name similarity cases (exact, alias, small typo, false match).
   - date tolerance tests.
   - numeric tolerance tests.
3. Integration test: mock scraper that returns controlled snapshots; run end-to-end grading and assert expected numeric outputs (raw→scaled→points).
4. End-to-end example with sample company record (verified) and sample submission showing the full JSON response.
5. OpenAPI (Swagger) spec for all endpoints used by grader and admin review.
6. README with deployment instructions and config description.

[SECURITY & OPERATIONAL]
- API must authenticate callers (API keys or JWT). Rate limit grading calls per team.
- Cache fetched snapshots for TTL (configurable) to reduce repeated scraping.
- Job queue for fetch/render tasks (Celery/RQ). The grader can perform quick DB-only checks synchronously; web fetches may be asynchronous: return pending status with submission_id, then callback/WebSocket when grading completes.
- Provide failure modes: "best-effort synchronous" with timeouts or "enqueue and notify" option.

[EXAMPLE INPUT + EXPECTED OUTPUT SNIPPET]
Example request:
POST /grade_submission
{
 "team":"Alpha",
 "battle_no":1,
 "submission_id":"sub-001",
 "time_taken_seconds":1200,
 "total_time_seconds":1800,
 "company_reference":{"company_id":"uuid-1","use_db_as_primary":true},
 "fields":{"company_name":"Example Co","founders":[{"name":"Jane Doe"}],"founding_year":2018}
}

Expected key parts of response:
{
 "submission_id":"sub-001",
 "raw_ai_percent": 64.0,
 "scaled_battle_percent": 75.2941176,
 "battle_points_out_of_20": 15.05882352,
 "breakdown": {
    "data_accuracy_raw": 44.0,
    "speed_raw": 8.0,

    "source_credibility":0.85,
    "source_verified": true
 },
 "diagnostics": {...},
 "escalated_for_human_review": false,
 "confidence": 0.91
}

[NON-FUNCTIONAL / TECH STACK RECOMMENDATION]
- Preferred language: **Python** (fast development; libraries: httpx, Playwright, pdfminer/tika, pytesseract, rapidfuzz, sentence-transformers if needed).
- Web framework: **FastAPI** (async, typed, easy OpenAPI).
- DB: **Postgres** (production) with JSONB for company canonical records. MVP may use SQLite.
- Snapshot storage: S3 or S3-compatible (MinIO for local).
- Queue: Redis + Celery or RQ.
- Search/index: Postgres FTS or Elasticsearch for advanced search.
- Containerize (Docker); deploy worker pool separately from API.
- Logging & monitoring: Prometheus+Grafana + ELK/Sentry.

[OPERATIONS & SLA]
- Synchronous grading (DB-only) should respond <500ms p95.
- If web-fetching required, either:
  - perform background job and return "pending" immediately, OR
  - allow synchronous with timeout (e.g., 12s) but prefer background to keep mobile responsive.
- Set service quotas to avoid being blocked by target sites.

[FINAL INSTRUCTION]
Return code & tests implementing all above. Ensure determinism, audit trail, and the strict presence rule (if not in provided source -> zero). Provide an admin guide for thresholds and deployable Docker Compose for demo.
